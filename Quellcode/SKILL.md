# OPT Playwright Test Generation — Skill

You generate end-to-end tests for a web application using Playwright with TypeScript. These conventions are fixed and apply to every test you produce.

## Output

- Return exactly ONE Playwright test file as valid TypeScript and nothing else.
- No markdown code fences, no explanation before or after the code.
- The first two lines must be the SPDX license header:
    ```

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
    ```
- Followed by: `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';`
- Use a single `test(...)` block. The test title must contain the use case id and title.
- Do not use `test.describe`, `test.beforeEach`, or custom fixtures. All logic, including precondition checks, belongs in the single test body.
- Begin the test by navigating to the base URL given in the prompt
  (`await page.goto(...)`).

## Locators

- Prefer `getByTestId` whenever a test id is available — test ids are stable and unambiguous.
- Fall back to user-facing properties (`getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`) only for elements without a test id. Prefer `getByRole` with an accessible name over `getByText`, as plain text matches are often ambiguous.
- Do not use CSS selectors or XPath bound to the DOM structure.
- If an element has no accessible role, label, visible text, or test id, a scoped CSS class selector may be used as a last resort.
- Chakra UI form controls (checkbox, switch, radio) render the real `role`-bearing `<input>` visually hidden underneath a decorative control element (`chakra-checkbox__control` etc.) that intercepts pointer events. Clicking the `getByRole('checkbox' | 'switch' | 'radio')` locator therefore hangs until timeout ("… intercepts pointer events"). Use `click({ force: true })` on the role locator to toggle such a control, and assert the result separately (`toBeChecked()`). Do not switch to `getByText()` for clicking — visible label texts are often ambiguous (headings, list items) and cause strict mode violations.
- Accessible names must be unambiguous. When one control's name is a substring of another's (e.g. "Search" vs "Search Address", or a toolbar toggle and a button of the same name inside a dialog), `getByRole(..., { name })` matches several elements and fails with a strict mode violation. Use `{ exact: true }` and/or scope the lookup to the relevant container (`page.getByRole('dialog', { name }).getByRole(...)`).
- A `data-testid` is NOT an element `id`. Never target it with a CSS id selector such as `page.locator('#some-testid')` — that selector matches nothing and the call hangs until timeout. Always use `getByTestId('some-testid')`. To interact with the map, click the map container element (identified via the context provided in the prompt) with a `position` option.
- Toolbar toggle buttons may already be in the active state (`aria-pressed="true"`). Clicking such a toggle blindly closes the panel instead of opening it. Treat the desired end state as the source of truth: assert the panel's visibility, and only click the toggle when its current pressed state does not already match the state the use case requires.

## Waiting and assertions

- Use `async`/`await` for every Playwright call.
- Use web-first, auto-retrying `expect` assertions (e.g. `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`).
- For asynchronous values that are not covered by Playwright's built-in auto-retrying assertions (e.g. values read from application state rather than the DOM), use `expect.poll(() => ...)` instead of a single `expect(await ...)`, since the latter evaluates the value only once and does not wait for it to settle.
- `expect.poll(callback)` already awaits the callback's return value. Do NOT chain `.resolves` after it (`expect.poll(...).resolves` is unsupported and throws) — return the value from the callback and assert on it directly.
- Choose the matcher to fit the polled value: `.toBe` / `.toEqual` for equality, `.toMatch(/regex/)` for a string pattern, `.toContain(x)` only for a substring or array membership. Never pass a regex to `.toContain` — use `.toMatch` instead.
- Do not use fixed waits (no `waitForTimeout`, no `sleep`).
- For steps that depend on network responses or page loads, use `waitForResponse` / `waitForLoadState`.
- To verify that a specific network request was sent, register a `page.on('request', ...)` listener before performing the triggering action, then assert on the captured request (e.g. with `expect.poll()`).
- For actions that trigger a file download, call `page.waitForEvent('download')` before performing the triggering action, then await the resulting download and assert on it (e.g. `suggestedFilename()`).
- Derive the assertions from the `expected_result` field of the use case.
- Cover the steps in order as a single user flow.

## Application under test (framework-level background)

- The application is built with Open Pioneer Trails (React + Chakra UI, TypeScript).
- The map is rendered with OpenLayers onto an HTML `<canvas>`. Map content — the active layers, features, zoom level and map position — is NOT represented as DOM elements and therefore cannot be asserted through DOM locators.
- Open Pioneer Trails components follow ARIA conventions and can expose a `data-testid`. Test ids are not assigned automatically; they exist only where set in the application code.
- Geodata (map tiles, WMS layers, GetFeatureInfo, geocoder requests) load asynchronously over the network and appear only after the response has arrived.

## Map state via helper functions (only if provided in the prompt)

If the prompt provides map model helper functions, the following rules apply. If no helpers are provided, this section is irrelevant — do not invent or import any helper module.

- Map state (active base layer, operational layer visibility, zoom level, center, highlighted coordinate) is not in the DOM. Read it only through the helper functions provided in the prompt.
- Import the helpers with a single STATIC top-level import using exactly the import path stated in the prompt. Never use a dynamic `await import(...)` — it fails at runtime with "SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'". Never guess a different relative path — it fails with "Cannot find module".
- Every helper returns `undefined` until the map is ready, and reflects the result of a triggering action only after its asynchronous effect has completed. Never assert on a single `await helper(page)`; always wrap the call in `expect.poll(() => helper(page))` so it retries until the value settles.
